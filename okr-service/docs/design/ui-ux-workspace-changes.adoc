= UI/UX Design Changes - Workspace Management

== Overview

This document describes the UI/UX changes made to implement workspace management functionality and improve the overall user experience.

== Layout Changes

=== Header Improvements

The header has been enhanced to better display user information:

* **User Information Display**: 
  - User name and email are now displayed in a more prominent way
  - User avatar is always visible (both desktop and mobile)

* **Visual Hierarchy**:
  - User name is displayed in bold
  - Email is shown in smaller, muted text
  - Avatar provides visual identification
  - Consistent spacing and alignment

=== Sidebar Restructuring

The sidebar has been restructured to prioritize workspace management:

* **Workspace Selector at Top**:
  - Moved workspace selector to the top of sidebar
  - Interactive dropdown with workspace switching capability
  - Shows current workspace name and status
  - Quick access to create new workspace

* **Removed User Info from Sidebar**:

== Implementation Notes

=== Component Structure

```
Layout
├── WorkspaceProvider
│   ├── Sidebar
│   │   └── WorkspaceSelector
│   └── Header
│       └── UserInfo
└── Main Content
```

=== State Flow

1. App loads → WorkspaceProvider initializes
2. WorkspaceProvider loads workspaces from API
3. First workspace set as current (if available)
4. WorkspaceSelector displays current workspace
5. User can switch workspaces via dropdown
6. Context updates current workspace globally

=== Error Handling

* **API Failures**:
  - Graceful fallback to empty state
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Retry mechanisms

* **Authentication Issues**:
  - Redirect to login if token invalid
  - Clear workspace state on logout
  - Proper cleanup on auth changes

== Conclusion

These changes significantly improve the user experience by:

1. **Better Information Architecture**: User info in header, workspace management in sidebar
2. **Improved Navigation**: Workspace switching is now prominent and accessible
3. **Enhanced Context**: Global workspace state management
4. **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes
5. **Accessibility**: Proper keyboard and screen reader support

The new design follows modern UI/UX principles and provides a solid foundation for future workspace management features.
